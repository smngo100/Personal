HTML elements: <button>, <p>
Element is a generic term that we use to describe anything that we can display on the webpage

Syntax: Rules for writing code, grammar (for code)
<>/ 


HTML Tag: Tells the computer what we're trying to create (e.g. <button>)
* Every element consists of two tags. an opening tag and a closing tag 
* closing tag has a </tag_name> '/' in front of the tag name

<a> = anchor element, link to another website

HTML attribute: modifies how an element behaves 


CSS - used to style our webpage, change the appearnance of our HTML elements

General Technique: 
1. Create element with HTML
2. Style with CSS one-by-one

.<class_name> the . targets the class



pseudo styles: add extra styles in certain situations

box-shadow creates a shadow behind the button
box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 
takes 4 values 
1) horizontal positional of the shadow
2) vertical position of the shadow
3) blur  
4) color 


Margin: spacing on the outside of the element
Padding: spacing on the inside of the element

CSS Box Model: how much space an element takes up, and how far awway it is from other elements

padding is a better alternative to height x width because it adjusts to the contents if we ever need to modify it
Box model determines how much space an element takes up on the page


The selector that's more specifi has higher priority
class name selecotr has more priorirty than the element name selector 


Text Element
* Text element: An element that is inside a line of text
* They exists inside a line of txt and modify that part of the text. not modifying the whole tihng 

<span></span> most generic text elemenets, has no style, can give it a class and can style it ourselves and give it any style we want. lets us modify a specific part of the text without modifying the whole thing. most flexible. can style it however we want.

<!DOCTYPE html> 
* tells browser to use modern version of HTML it'll fall back to an older version that has less features

nesting: can have elments inside elements

<html> = web page
<body></body> = contains all elements that are visible

<link> is a special elemnet, it doesn't require a CLOSING TAG 
* called a void element
* void elemnets don't need a closing tag
