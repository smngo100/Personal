Three numeric data types built-in to Python: 
  1. integers - int 
  2. floating point numbers - float 
  3. complex numbers - complex 

Following operators are defined for all three numeric types above: 
  * Addition: + 
  * Subtraction/Negation: - 
  * Multiplication: * 
  * Division: / 
  * Exponentiation: ** 

Operates defined for int and float: 
  * Floor division: // 
  * Modulo (Remainder): % 

Python follows the PEMDAS order of operations: 
P - parenthesses
E - exponents 
M - multiplication, modulo, or 
D - division 
A - addition, or 
S - subtraction
