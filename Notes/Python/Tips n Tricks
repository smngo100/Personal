* Way to decide if you're unsure whether to use the del statement or the pop() method: 
    * When you want to delete an item from a list and not use that item in any way use del statment (ex. del variable[index]
    * When you want to use an item as you remove it, use the pop() methood (ex. variable.pop(index)
