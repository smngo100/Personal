# Variables 
* Every variable holds a value, which is the information associated with that variable 

# Variables are Labels
* Often described as boxes you can store values in (helpful but not accurate way to describe how they're represented in Python)
* Better to think of variables as LABELS that you can assign to values
    Example: Think of values 1, 2, 3
              You're holding papers (THE LABEL) and you assign labels one, two, three to the values 1, 2, 3

# String:  Series of characters

# Method 
* An action that Python can perform on a piece of data
* Every method is followed by a set of parentheses 
Example
name = "ada lovelace"
print(name.title())
* The dot (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name

# f - string: The f is for format, because Python formats the string by replacing the name of anyu variable in braces with its value.

# whitespaces: refer to nonprinting character, such as spaces, tabs, and end-of-line symbols
* \t to add a tab to text 
* \n to add a newline in a string 

# Syntax error: errors when Python doesn't recognize a section of your program as valid Python code.

# Float: Any number with a decimal point. This term refers to the face that a decimal point can appear at any position in a number.
* Python defaults to a float in any operation that uses a float, even if the output is a whole number.

# Constant: A variable whose value stays the same throughour the life of a program.
* Python programmers use all CAPITAL letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed.
Example
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000

# Comment: Allows user to write notes in their spoken language, within the programs.

# List: A collection of items in a particular order.
