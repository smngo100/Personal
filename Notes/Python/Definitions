# Variables 
* Every variable holds a value, which is the information associated with that variable 

# Variables are Labels
* Often described as boxes you can store values in (helpful but not accurate way to describe how they're represented in Python)
* Better to think of variables as LABELS that you can assign to values
    Example: Think of values 1, 2, 3
              You're holding papers (THE LABEL) and you assign labels one, two, three to the values 1, 2, 3

# String 
* Series of characters
* Can use single or double quotations around strings

# Method 
* An action that Python can perform on a piece of data
* Every method is followed by a set of parentheses 
Example
name = "ada lovelace"
print(name.title())
* The dot (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() methjod act on the variable name
