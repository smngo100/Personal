range() 

The range() function is exclusive of the end value. When you call range(start, stop), it includes start but excludes stop.

Example:
years = 5 
for i in range(years): 
  print(i, end = " ") 

Output: 
0 1 2 3 4

# To make it inclusive, add 1 to the stop value
years = 5 
for i in range(years + 1): 
  print(i, end = " ") 

Output: 
0 1 2 3 4 5
