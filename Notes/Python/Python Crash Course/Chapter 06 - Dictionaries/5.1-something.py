# Dictionary: A collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. 
# Note: A key's value can be a number, a string, a list, or even enother dictionary. Basically, you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary.
