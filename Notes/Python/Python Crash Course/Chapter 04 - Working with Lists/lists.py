#A CLOSER LOOK AT LOOPING
# Set of steps is repeated once for each item in the list, no matter how many items are in the list.

#DOING MORE WORK WITHIN A FOR LOOP

#DOING SOMETHING AFTER A FOR LOOP
# After a for loop, the user tends to display a message after all of the individual messages have been printed.
