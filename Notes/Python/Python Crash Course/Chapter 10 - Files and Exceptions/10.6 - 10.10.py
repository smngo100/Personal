# 10-6. Addition
"""
One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. 
When you try to convert the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. 
Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print the result. 
Catch the ValueError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. 
Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.

Make two files, cats.txt and dogs.txt. Store at least three names of cats in the 
first file and three names of dogs in the second file.
