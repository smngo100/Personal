"""
Module: a file ending in .py that contaisn the code you wan tto import into your program

Each function in the module is available through the following syntax:
  module_name.function_name() 


You can also import a SPECIFIC FUNCTION from a module: 
  from module_name import function_name
* Note: when you import just the function you're going to use, with this syntax, you don't need to use the dot notation when yoou call a function. 
        because we've explicitly imported the function in the import statement, we can call it by name when we use the function

You can import as many functions as you want from a module by separating each function's name with a comma: 
  from module_name import function_0, function_1, function_2
