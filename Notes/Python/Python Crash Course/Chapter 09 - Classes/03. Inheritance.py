# Inheritance: When one class inherits from another, it takes on the attributes and methods of the first class.
# Parent class: The original class 
# Child class: The new class that can inherit any or all of the attributes and methods of its parent class, but it's also free to define new attributes and methods of its own.

# The name of the parent class must be included in the parentheses in the definition of a child class. 

# super() function is a special function that allows you to call a method from the parent class
