// C++ reserves a set of 92 words for its own use. These words are called keywords (or reserved words). Each of these keywords has a special meaning within the C++ language.

// Identifier naming rules 
/* The identifier can not be a keyword. Keywords are reserved.
The identifier can only be composed of letters (lower or upper case), numbers, and the underscore character. That means the name can not contain symbols (except the underscore) 
nor whitespace (spaces or tabs). The identifier must begin with a letter (lower or upper case) or an underscore. It can not start with a number. 
C++ is case sensitive, and thus distinguishes between lower and upper case letters. nvalue is different than nValue is different than NVALUE. */


// Identifier naming best practices 
// Convetional that variable names begin with a lowercase letter 
// Often, function names start with a lowercase letter 
// If variable or function is multi-word, there are 2 common conventions: 
  // Words seprated underscores (snake_case) 
  // Intercapped (camelCase, since the capital letters stick up like the humps on a camel)
