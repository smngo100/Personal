5.2 - Literals 

// Literals are values that are inserted directly into the code
  // Aka literal constants because their meaning cannot be reddefined 
// The type of a literal is deduced from the literal's value (e.g. 5 deducted to be of type int)
  
// A string is a collection of sequential characters used to represent text (such as names, words, and sentences) 
// Avoid magic numbers
