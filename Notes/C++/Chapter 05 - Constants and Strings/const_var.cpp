// A constant is a value that cannot be change during a program's execution.

// 2 kinds of constants: 
  // 1) Name constants are constant values that are assocaited with an identifier. Also called symbolic constants. 
  // 2) Literal constants are constant values that are not associated with an identifier.

// Constant variable: A variable whose value cannot be changed after initialization.

///// Declaring a constant variable /////
const double gravity { 9.8 }; // preferred use of const before type 

// Place const before the type 
// Don't use const for value parameters
// Don't use const when returning by value
