4.1 - Introduction to fundamental data types

// The smallest unit of memory is a binary digit (aka bit), which can hold a value of 0 or 1. 
// Memory is organized into sequential units called memory addresses (or addresses) 
// A byte is a group of bits that are operated on as a unit. 
// 1 byte = 8 bits 


//////////////////// Data types ////////////////////
// Data type (aka type) tells the compiler how to interpret the contents of memory in some meaningful way.

//////////////////// Fundamental data types ////////////////////
// Fundamental data types (aka basic types or primitive types) are predefined data types

//////////////////// Integer vs integral types ////////////////////
// The standard integer types are short, int, long, long long 
// The integral types are bool, the various char types, and the standard integer types 

//////////////////// The _t suffix ////////////////////
// e.g. std::nullptr_t use a _t suffix, which means "type"
// applied to modern types, but many types don't have it, so it's not consistently applied
