4.4 - Signed integers 

// An integer is an integral type that can represent positive and negative whole numbers, including 0.

//////////////////// Signed integers ////////////////////
// The attribute of being positive, negative, or zero is called the number's sign.
// By default, integers in C++ are signed, which means the number's sign is stored as part of the value. 


//////////////////// Defining signed integers ////////////////////
// Prefer the shorthand types that do not use the int suffix or signed prefix 


//////////////////// Signed integer ranges ////////////////////
// The set of specific values that a data type can hold is its range. 
// The range of an integer variable is deteremined by two factors: 
  // 1) its size (in bits)
  // 2) whether it's signed or not.
