// The char data type was designed to hold a single character
// A character can be a single letter, number, symbol, or whitespace
// ASCII stands for American Code for Information Interchange 
// Character literals are always placed between single quotes (e.g. 'g', '1', '')

// Initializing chars 
char ch2{ 'a' };   // preferred
char ch1{ 97 };    // not preferred
