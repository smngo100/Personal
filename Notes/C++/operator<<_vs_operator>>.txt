 
std::cin and std::cout always go on the left-hand side of the operator.

std::cout is used to output a value (cout = character output).

std:cin is used to get an input value (cin = character input). 

<< is used with std::cout, and shows the direction that data is moving. 
      std::cout << 4 moves the value 4 to the console.

>> is used with std:cin, and shows the direction that data is moving. 
      std::cin >> x moves the value the user entered from the keyboard into variable x.

Analogy: 
Imagine a pipe. 
      << is like pushing something into the pipe. 
            std::cout << "Hello, world!";
            The string is being pushed (printed) to the console.
      >> is like pulling something out of the pipe.
            std::cin >> name;
            The user's input is being pulled out of the input stream and stored in the variable.
