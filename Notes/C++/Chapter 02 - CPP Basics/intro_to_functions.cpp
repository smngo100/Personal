2.1 - Introduction to Functions 

// Function: A resusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job. 
// User-defined functions: Functions you write yourself.
// A function call tells the CPU to interrupt the current function and execute another function. 
  // The CPU essentialy "puts a bookmark" at the current point of execution, executes the functon named in the function call, 
  // and then returns to the point it bookmarked and resumes execution.
// Caller: The function initiating the function call. 
// Callee: The function being called (executed) 


////////// An example of a user-defined function ////////// 
returnType functionName() // This is the function header (tells the compiler about the existence of the function) 
{
  // This is the function body (tells the compiler what the function does) 
}

// The first line is called the function header; tells the compiler about the existence of a function, function's name, and other info.
// The curly braces and statements in-between are called the function body. This is where the statements that determine what your function does will go.


////////// Nested functions are not supported ////////// 
// Nested function: A function whose definition is placed inside another funciton.


////////// RANDOM ////////// 
// "foo" is a meanignless word that is often used as a placeholder name for a function or variable when the name is unimportant to the demonstration of some concept.
