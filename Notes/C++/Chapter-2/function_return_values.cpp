2.2 - Function return values (value-returning functions) 

////////// Return Values //////////
// To return a value back to the caller, 2 things are needed: 
  // 1. Function has to indicate what type of value will be returned.
    // Return type: The type that is defined before the function's name.
  // 2. Inside the funciton that will return a value, we use a return statement to indicate the specific value being returned to the caller. 
    // Consists of the return keyword, followed by an expression (aka return expression), ending with a semicolon.

// The process of returning a copied value back to the caller is named return by value.


////////// Staatus Code //////////
// The return value from main() is sometimes called a status code (or less comonly, an exit code, or rarely a return code).
// The status code is used to signal whether your program was successful or not.
