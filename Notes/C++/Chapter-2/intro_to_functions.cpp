2.1 - Introduction to Functions 

// Function: A resusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job. 
// User-defined functions: Functions you write yourself.
// A function call tells the CPU to interrupt the current function and execute another function. 
  // The CPU essentialy "puts a bookmark" at the current point of execution, executes the functon named in the function call, 
  // and then returns to the point it bookmarked and resumes execution.
