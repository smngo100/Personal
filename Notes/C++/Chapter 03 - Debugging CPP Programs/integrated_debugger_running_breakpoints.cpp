3.7 - Using an integrated debugger: Running and breakpoints

//////////////////// Run to cursor ////////////////////
// Run to cursor command executes the program until execution reaches the statement selected by your cursor
// It returns control to you so you can debug starting at that point

//////////////////// Continue ////////////////////
/* The continue debug command simply continues running the program as per normal, 
either until the program terminates, or until something triggers control to return back to you again */

//////////////////// Start ////////////////////
// The start command performs the same action as continue, just starting from the beginning of the program

//////////////////// Breakpoints ////////////////////
// A breakpoint is a special marker that tells the debugger to stop execution of the program at the breakpoint when running in debug mode
