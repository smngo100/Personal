1.9 - Introduction to literals and operators

////////// Literals //////////
// Literal (aka literal constant) is a fixed value that has been inserted directly into the source code.

///// Literals and variables Similarities and Differences /////
// Similar: Literals and variables both have a value (and a type) 
// Difference: Variable's value can be set and changed through initialization and assignment respectively. The value of a literal is fixed and cannot be changed.
  // The literal 5 always has value 5.
  // This is why literals are called constants.

// Literal value can be printed directly. In the case of the variable, the value 5 must be fetched from the memory the variable represents. 
// Explains why a literal is constant while a variable can be changed.
  // A literal's value is placed directly in the executable, and the executable itself can't be changed after it is created. 
  // A variable's value is placed in memory, and the value of the memory can be changed while the executable is running. 


////////// Operators //////////
// An operation is a process involving zero or more input values (called operands) that produce a new value (called an output value). 
// The specific operation to be performed is denoted by a symbol called an operator.
// THe output value of an operation is often called a return value.
// The number of operands that an operator takes as input is called the operator's arity.
// Operations in C++ come in four different arities: 
  // 1. Unary operators act on one operand 
  // 2. Binary operators act on two operands
  // 3. Ternary operators act on three operands
  // 4. Nullary operators act on zero operands
//
