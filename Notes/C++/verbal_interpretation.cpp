/* 
Can be read as: "Hello world!" is sent to the console
- cout stands for "character output" or "console output" 
- << is the output operator (like an arrow showing the direction of data flow) 

The text "Hello World!" is being sent to the character output stream, which in this case displays it in the console/terminal.
