new Promise((resolve) => {
  console.log('promise');
});

// When we create a promise, it runs the inner function immediately 
// It allows JavaScript to do multiple tihngs at the same time 
// Promise creates a separate thread of code 

resolve is a function 
- similar to done() funciton is Jasmine Test
- lets us control when to go to the next step 

Why we use Promises instead of callbacks? Multiple callbacks cause a lot of nesting 
Promises help keep our code flat and avoid nesting.
Use promises instead of callbacks

Promise.all() 
- lets us run multiple promises at the same time 
- and wait for all of them to finish 



async = makes a function return a promise 

What's the point of this feature? 
= async lets us use await 

await = lets us wait for a promise to finish, before going to the next line. it lets use write asynchronous code like normal code 

We can only use await, when we're inside an async function
