inheritance = lets us reuse code between classes 

- inheritance: allows one class to get all the properties and methods from another class, so we don't have to duplicate code 

ex) Take a look at the Amazon webpage. Notice that there are different types of products. We have appliances and clothing. They are different types of products from each other but they are still products.

Let's say we have two classes: 

class Product {}     // Parent class

class Clothing {}    // Child class

class Appliances {}  // Child class

If we have some properties that are only in clothing, or properties that are only in appliances we'll need separate classes. And since they're also products they'll need the code from the Product class, but how can we do this without duplicating all the Product class code into the other classes?

That's where inheritance comes in.
