Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- another style of programming (another way we write our code)
- OOP = organizing our code into objects
- organize code into an object



Procedural Programming 

- what we've been doing so far 
- procedure = a set of step-by-step instructions
            = function 
- organize our code into separate functions
