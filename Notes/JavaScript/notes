3 Technologies for creating websites 
1. HTML: Creates content for the website; buttons, text, images
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Changes the appearance of the website
3. JavaScript: Makes the website interactive 


-------------------- JavaScript Basics --------------------
What is JavaScript? 
- Giving instructions to a computer
- Computer follows our instructions 


// Some Code 
alert('message'); // Creates a pop up message 
document.body.innerHTML = 'hello'; // Replaces all content on page with this message

Basics of JavaScript 
- Code: Giving instructions to a computer
- Running the code: The computer follows our instructions 

Syntax: Rules that we have to follow when using a programming language 

In programming: 
2, 3, 4 = integers 
2.2, 2.5 = floating point numbers (floats) 
Computers have a problem working with floats


-------------------- Numbers and Math --------------------
// Float Calculations
Calcuations with floats are sometimes inaccurate.
So to avoid inaccuracies when working with money:
1. Do the calculation in cents 
2. Convert back to dollars 
Ex) $20.95 + $7.99 --> (2095 + 799) / 100 
Both expressions give the same result

Math.round()


-------------------- Strings --------------------
string = text
concatentation = when we combine strings together
type coercion (automatic type conversion)

// Numbers and strings are different types of values 


3 Ways to Create string 
1. '...'
2. "..."
3. `...`  = template string 
  * special feature: interpolation = insert value directly into a string
    $ {} = insert value directly into string
    Ex)  `Items (${1 + 1}): $${}`

Character: 
1. letter (a, b, c)
2. number (1, 2, 3)
3. symbol (!, @, #)
4. escape character \', \", \n

-------------------- HTML CSS Review, console.log  --------------------
Web page = a single page (on a website) 
(home page, cart page, etc.)

CSS review
CSS selector: Selects which elements to change
CSS Styles: How to change the appearance
 left side = CSS property: what we're changing
 right side = CSS value: what we're chnaging the property to

HTML attributes: change the behavior of an element 
<element_name attribute_name="attribute_value"> </element_name>
attribute_name: what we're changing about this element
attribute_value: what we're changing this attribute to 

to display js code
<script></script>
- OR - 
in an element onclick=""

-------------------- Variables --------------------
variable = a container 
let keyword creates a new variable 
Ex) let x = 5; // This is called assigning a value to a variable
               // When we reassign it's called re-assigning a value to a variable
                  // When re-assigning no need to put let 
                  Ex) x = 2;

Variable name restrictions: 
1. Can't use special words 
   Ex) let let = 5; NOT ALLOWED
2. Cant't start with a number 
   Ex) let 5bread = 2; NOT ALLOWED
       let br5ead = 2; ALLOWED
       let bread5 = 2; ALLOWED
3. Can't use special characters except: $, _

Naming Conventions 
camelCase       cartQuantity
PascalCase      CartQuantity
kebab-case      cart-quantity (doesn't work in JS but works in HTML & CSS)
snake_case      cart_quantity (not used in JS)
