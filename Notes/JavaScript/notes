3 Technologies for creating websites 
1. HTML: Creates content for the website; buttons, text, images
2. CSS: Changes the appearance of the website
3. JavaScript: Makes the website interactive 

What is JavaScript? 
- Giving instructions to a computer
- Computer follows our instructions 


----- Some codes -----
alert('message'); // Creates a pop up message 
document.body.innerHTML = 'hello'; // Replaces all content on page with this message

Basics of JavaScript 
- Code: Giving instructions to a computer
- Running the code: The computer follows our instructions 

Syntax: Rules that we have to follow when using a programming language 

In programming: 
2, 3, 4 = integers 
2.2, 2.5 = floating point numbers (floats) 
Computers have a problem working with floats

-------------------- Float Caclulations --------------------
Calcuations with floats are sometimes inaccurate.
So to avoid inaccuracies when working with money:
1. Do the calculation in cents 
2. Convert back to dollars 
Ex) $20.95 + $7.99 --> (2095 + 799) / 100 
Both expressions give the same result
