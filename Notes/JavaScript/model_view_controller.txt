MVC (Model - View - Controller) Technique 
1. Update the data
2. Regenerate all the HTML

- split our code into 3 parts 
1. Model = saves and manages the data 
2. View = takes the data and displays it on the page
3. Controller = runs some code when we interact with the page 

MVC = make sure the page always matches the data
- MVC is a design pattern 
- It's a way to organize and design our code
